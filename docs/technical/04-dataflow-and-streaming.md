# Dataflow and Streaming

## Overview

The Workglow task graph engine connects tasks through **dataflow edges** that carry typed data between output and input ports. While the DAG structure defines the dependency order, dataflows define the data contracts -- which output port feeds which input port, how values are propagated, and whether data flows as a complete materialized value or as a stream of incremental events.

This document covers two interconnected systems:

1. **Dataflow** -- the edge abstraction that connects task ports, carries values, and manages lifecycle status.
2. **Streaming** -- the system for incremental output delivery, including stream modes, stream events, the `x-stream` schema annotation, and delta accumulation.

Together, these systems enable everything from simple port-to-port value passing to real-time token-by-token streaming of AI model output through a multi-task pipeline.

---

## The Dataflow Class

### Identity and Structure

A `Dataflow` represents a single directed edge from one task's output port to another task's input port. It is defined by four identifiers:

```typescript
const dataflow = new Dataflow(
  sourceTaskId, // ID of the source task
  sourceTaskPortId, // Name of the output port on the source task
  targetTaskId, // ID of the target task
  targetTaskPortId // Name of the input port on the target task
);
```

The dataflow's `id` is a deterministic string derived from these four components:

```
sourceTaskId[sourceTaskPortId] ==> targetTaskId[targetTaskPortId]
```

For example: `"task-abc[result] ==> task-def[value]"`.

### State Management

Each dataflow maintains its own lifecycle state, mirroring the task lifecycle:

| Property | Type                          | Description                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `value`  | `any`                         | The materialized data carried by the dataflow |
| `status` | `TaskStatus`                  | Current lifecycle status                      |
| `error`  | `TaskError`                   | Error object if the dataflow failed           |
| `stream` | `ReadableStream<StreamEvent>` | Active stream for streaming tasks             |

The dataflow status transitions mirror the source task's execution:

```
PENDING --> PROCESSING --> STREAMING --> COMPLETED
                            |
                            +--> FAILED
```

### Value Propagation

When the TaskGraphRunner pushes output from a completed task onto outgoing dataflows, it calls `setPortData(entireDataBlock)`:

```typescript
// If sourceTaskPortId is a specific port name:
dataflow.value = entireDataBlock[sourceTaskPortId];

// If sourceTaskPortId is "*" (DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS):
dataflow.value = entireDataBlock; // Entire output object

// If sourceTaskPortId is "[error]" (DATAFLOW_ERROR_PORT):
dataflow.error = entireDataBlock;
```

When the runner copies input from dataflows into a target task, it calls `getPortData()`:

```typescript
// If targetTaskPortId is a specific port name:
return { [targetTaskPortId]: dataflow.value };

// If targetTaskPortId is "*" (DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS):
return dataflow.value; // Entire value object

// If targetTaskPortId is "[error]" (DATAFLOW_ERROR_PORT):
return { "[error]": dataflow.error };
```

### Special Port Identifiers

| Constant              | Value       | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS`  | `"*"`       | Pass the entire output/input object, not a single port |
| `DATAFLOW_ERROR_PORT` | `"[error]"` | Route error objects between tasks for error handling   |

The wildcard port `"*"` is used when a task should receive the complete output object from its upstream dependency, rather than a single named property.

### Semantic Compatibility

Dataflows validate that source and target ports are semantically compatible by inspecting their JSON Schema types:

```typescript
dataflow.semanticallyCompatible(graph, dataflow);
// Returns: "static" | "runtime" | "incompatible"
```

| Result           | Meaning                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `"static"`       | Types are statically compatible                 |
| `"runtime"`      | Compatibility can only be determined at runtime |
| `"incompatible"` | Types are known to be incompatible              |

Compatibility results are cached for tasks with stable schemas. Tasks with `hasDynamicSchemas = true` bypass the cache because their schemas may change between checks.

### Reset

Calling `dataflow.reset()` returns the dataflow to its initial state:

```typescript
dataflow.reset();
// value = undefined
// status = PENDING
// error = undefined
// stream = undefined
// compatibility cache cleared
```

---

## The Port System

### Port Definition via JSON Schema

Task input and output ports are defined by the `properties` of the JSON Schema returned by `inputSchema()` and `outputSchema()`. Each property name is a port identifier, and the property's schema defines the port's type contract.

```typescript
static outputSchema(): DataPortSchema {
  return {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      text: { type: "string", title: "Generated Text" },
      confidence: { type: "number", minimum: 0, maximum: 1 },
    },
  } as const satisfies DataPortSchema;
}
```

This task has two output ports: `text` (string) and `confidence` (number).

### Schema Annotations

Ports support several custom annotations beyond standard JSON Schema:

| Annotation            | Type      | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-stream`            | `string`  | Streaming mode: `"append"`, `"replace"`, or `"object"`                        |
| `x-ui-hidden`         | `boolean` | Hide from UI display                                                          |
| `x-ui-iteration`      | `boolean` | Iteration context port (hidden from parent display)                           |
| `x-ui-manual`         | `boolean` | User-added port (dynamic)                                                     |
| `x-auto-generated`    | `boolean` | Auto-generated primary key                                                    |
| `x-structured-output` | `boolean` | Port schema used for structured AI output                                     |
| `format`              | `string`  | Semantic type hint (e.g., `"model"`, `"storage:tabular"`, `"knowledge-base"`) |

---

## Streaming Primitive Contract

Workglow's streaming layer uses three primitives that serve distinct, non-overlapping roles. Authors only ever write one of them. The other two are engine internals.

### The Three Primitives

| Primitive                     | Role                | Where it appears                                       | Who writes it                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `AsyncIterable<StreamEvent>`  | Authoring           | `Task.executeStream()`, `AiProviderStreamFn`           | Task / provider authors           |
| `ReadableStream<StreamEvent>` | Engine-internal tee | `Dataflow.stream`, `TaskGraphRunner` fan-out           | Engine only (do not use in tasks) |
| `EventEmitter` (task events)  | Observation only    | `stream_start`, `stream_chunk`, `stream_end` on `Task` | Engine emits; consumers subscribe |

### Authoring Rule: AsyncIterable

**All streaming tasks and providers MUST return `AsyncIterable<StreamEvent>` -- typically as an `async function*` generator.**

```typescript
// Task: use `async *executeStream()`
async *executeStream(input, context): AsyncIterable<StreamEvent> {
  yield { type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: "Hello" };
  yield { type: "finish", data: {} as Output };
}

// Provider: the `AiProviderStreamFn` signature IS an AsyncIterable-returning function
export const MyProvider_Stream: AiProviderStreamFn = async function* (input, model, signal) {
  for await (const delta of underlyingSdk.stream(input, { signal })) {
    yield { type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: delta };
  }
  yield { type: "finish", data: {} };
};
```

Why AsyncIterable for authoring:

- **Pull-based backpressure is inherent.** When the consumer is slow, `yield` suspends the generator. No buffer bloat without writing any extra code.
- **Cancel cleanup is natural.** A `try { ... } finally { ... }` in the generator runs when the consumer stops iterating -- including on `AbortSignal` firing.
- **Trivial to write.** One `async function*`; no manual controller plumbing.

### Engine-Internal: ReadableStream

`ReadableStream<StreamEvent>` exists in exactly two engine-internal places:

- `Dataflow.stream` -- the edge-level stream attached to dataflows that carry streaming data between tasks.
- `TaskGraphRunner` fan-out -- when one upstream streaming task feeds multiple downstream consumers, the engine uses `ReadableStream.tee()` to split the stream cleanly.

Why ReadableStream is the right tool here:

- `tee()` is the correct fan-out primitive -- splitting an `AsyncIterable` to N consumers would require building (and maintaining) a custom broadcaster.
- `cancel()` back-propagates to the producer, matching the existing abort plumbing.
- It is a Web-platform standard available uniformly in browsers, workers, Node, and Bun.

**Authors do not write `ReadableStream` directly.** The engine wraps task-authored `AsyncIterable`s into `ReadableStream`s at the dataflow edge. If you find yourself reaching for `new ReadableStream(...)` in a task, you are on the wrong layer.

One exception lives in `HFT_Pipeline.ts`: that code wraps an HTTP `Response.body` (already a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`) into an abort-aware, pull-based `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` for multi-GB model downloads. That wrapping is below the task layer -- it is shaping an external I/O primitive, not authoring a task stream.

### Observation-Only: EventEmitter

Tasks emit `stream_start`, `stream_chunk`, and `stream_end` via `EventEmitter` for UI and telemetry observers. These events:

- **MUST NOT** be used for data transfer between tasks. Data transfer goes through dataflows (AsyncIterable -> engine tee -> downstream consumer).
- Carry no backpressure. A slow listener cannot slow a producer. This is intentional -- observers must never be able to stall the pipeline.
- Are safe to subscribe to from any number of listeners.

### Which Primitive Do I Use?

| Task                                            | Answer                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Writing a new task that streams output          | `async *executeStream()` returning `AsyncIterable`     |
| Writing a new AI provider stream function       | `AiProviderStreamFn` (async generator)                 |
| Passing streaming data between two tasks        | Don't -- the engine handles this via dataflows         |
| Forking one stream to multiple downstream tasks | Don't -- the engine tees via `ReadableStream.tee()`    |
| Subscribing to streaming progress from the UI   | `graph.subscribeToTaskStreaming({...})` (EventEmitter) |
| Logging or telemetry on streaming lifecycle     | `task.on("stream_chunk", ...)` (EventEmitter)          |

---

## Stream Modes

### The x-stream Annotation

The `x-stream` annotation on output port schemas declares how a task produces streaming output. When a task's output schema includes ports with `x-stream`, and the task implements `executeStream()`, the TaskRunner uses the streaming execution path.

### Available Stream Modes

#### none (default)

No streaming. The task returns its output as a complete `Promise<Output>` from `execute()`. This is the default when `x-stream` is absent.

```typescript
// No x-stream annotation: standard execution
properties: {
  result: {
    type: "string",
  },
}
```

#### append

Each chunk is a **text delta** -- a new token or fragment to be appended to the accumulated output. The consumer is responsible for concatenating deltas.

```typescript
properties: {
  text: {
    type: "string",
    "x-stream": "append",  // Token-by-token streaming
  }
}
```

Produces `StreamTextDelta` events:

```typescript
{ type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: " Hello" }
{ type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: " world" }
{ type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: "!" }
// Accumulated: " Hello world!"
```

#### replace

Each chunk is a **complete snapshot** of the output so far. The consumer replaces its state with the latest snapshot.

```typescript
properties: {
  image: {
    type: "object",
    "x-stream": "replace",  // Progressive refinement
  }
}
```

Produces `StreamSnapshot` events:

```typescript
{ type: "snapshot", data: { image: lowResVersion } }
{ type: "snapshot", data: { image: mediumResVersion } }
{ type: "snapshot", data: { image: highResVersion } }
```

#### object

Each chunk is a **progressively more complete partial object**. The consumer replaces (not merges) its state with each update.

```typescript
properties: {
  structured: {
    type: "object",
    "x-stream": "object",  // Structured streaming
  }
}
```

Produces `StreamObjectDelta` events:

```typescript
{ type: "object-delta", port: "structured", objectDelta: { name: "Al" } }
{ type: "object-delta", port: "structured", objectDelta: { name: "Alice", age: 30 } }
{ type: "object-delta", port: "structured", objectDelta: { name: "Alice", age: 30, role: "Engineer" } }
```

#### mixed

When multiple output ports use different stream modes, the overall task stream mode is `"mixed"`. This is detected automatically by `getOutputStreamMode()`:

```typescript
properties: {
  text: { type: "string", "x-stream": "append" },
  metadata: { type: "object", "x-stream": "object" },
}
// getOutputStreamMode() returns "mixed"
```

---

## StreamEvent Types

All streaming data flows through the `StreamEvent` discriminated union type:

```typescript
type StreamEvent<Output = Record<string, any>> =
  | StreamTextDelta
  | StreamObjectDelta
  | StreamSnapshot<Output>
  | StreamFinish<Output>
  | StreamError;
```

### StreamTextDelta

```typescript
interface StreamTextDelta {
  type: "text-delta";
  port: string; // Output port name
  textDelta: string; // Incremental text fragment
}
```

Used with `x-stream: "append"`. Each event carries a fragment of text that should be appended to the accumulated result for the named port.

### StreamObjectDelta

```typescript
interface StreamObjectDelta {
  type: "object-delta";
  port: string; // Output port name
  objectDelta: Record<string, unknown> | unknown[]; // Progressive partial object
}
```

Used with `x-stream: "object"`. Each event carries a progressively more complete object snapshot. Consumers should **replace** (not merge) their state with the latest delta.

### StreamSnapshot

```typescript
interface StreamSnapshot<Output = Record<string, any>> {
  type: "snapshot";
  data: Output; // Complete snapshot of current output state
}
```

Used with `x-stream: "replace"`. Each event carries a full snapshot of the output. During graph execution, the runner updates `task.runOutputData` with the snapshot before emitting the `stream_chunk` event.

### StreamFinish

```typescript
interface StreamFinish<Output = Record<string, any>> {
  type: "finish";
  data: Output; // Final output data
}
```

Signals that the stream has ended. In append mode, the TaskRunner enriches this event with accumulated text (when `shouldAccumulate` is true). In replace mode, `data` contains the final output.

**Provider convention**: Provider stream functions must yield `{ type: "finish", data: {} as Output }` -- an empty finish event. The TaskRunner handles accumulation. Providers must not accumulate deltas themselves.

### StreamError

```typescript
interface StreamError {
  type: "error";
  error: Error; // The error that occurred
}
```

Signals that the stream encountered a fatal error. The TaskRunner throws this error, transitioning the task to `FAILED` status.

---

## Stream Lifecycle

### 1. Detection

Before executing a task, the TaskRunner checks whether streaming is appropriate:

```typescript
function isTaskStreamable(task): boolean {
  // Must implement executeStream()
  if (typeof task.executeStream !== "function") return false;
  // Must have at least one x-stream annotated output port
  return getOutputStreamMode(task.outputSchema()) !== "none";
}
```

If a task declares streaming output via `x-stream` but does not implement `executeStream()`, the runner falls back to non-streaming `execute()` and logs a warning.

### 2. Stream Start

When streaming begins, the TaskRunner:

1. Validates the output schema has appropriate `x-stream` annotations
2. Emits `stream_start` event on the task
3. Calls `task.executeStream(input, context)` to obtain the async iterable
4. Begins consuming events

### 3. Chunk Processing

For each event from the async iterable:

```
text-delta:
  - Accumulate text per-port (if shouldAccumulate)
  - Emit "stream_chunk" on the task
  - Update progress (asymptotic curve: 1 - e^(-0.05*chunkCount))

object-delta:
  - Accumulate per-port (if shouldAccumulate)
  - Update runOutputData progressively
  - Emit "stream_chunk"

snapshot:
  - Update runOutputData BEFORE emitting (so listeners see latest state)
  - Emit "stream_chunk"

finish:
  - If accumulating: merge accumulated text/objects into finish data
  - Set finalOutput
  - Emit enriched "stream_chunk" with complete data

error:
  - Throw the error (handled by run()'s catch block)
```

After the first chunk, the task status transitions to `STREAMING`.

### 4. Stream End

After all events are consumed:

1. Check if the task was aborted during streaming
2. Set `task.runOutputData` to the final accumulated output
3. Emit `stream_end` event with the complete output
4. Return the final output

---

## Delta Accumulation

### The shouldAccumulate Flag

The TaskRunner's `shouldAccumulate` flag controls whether text-delta and object-delta events are accumulated into a final output value:

- **`true` (default)**: Text deltas are concatenated per-port. Object deltas are stored per-port. The finish event is enriched with accumulated data before emission.
- **`false`**: All events pass through unmodified. No accumulation maps are maintained.

### When Accumulation is Needed

The graph runner sets `shouldAccumulate` based on whether any downstream edge needs materialized data:

- **Accumulate**: When the task has downstream dataflows that need complete values, or when caching is enabled.
- **Don't accumulate**: When all downstream edges are also streaming (pure pass-through) and no cache is needed.

### Accumulation Example

Given a streaming AI task with `x-stream: "append"` on the `text` port:

```
Event 1: { type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: "Hello" }
Event 2: { type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: " world" }
Event 3: { type: "text-delta", port: "text", textDelta: "!" }
Event 4: { type: "finish", data: { model: "gpt-4" } }  // Provider finish (no text)
```

With `shouldAccumulate = true`, the runner:

1. Accumulates: `text -> "Hello world!"`
2. On finish: merges accumulated text into finish data
3. Emits enriched finish: `{ type: "finish", data: { text: "Hello world!", model: "gpt-4" } }`
4. Downstream dataflows receive `{ text: "Hello world!", model: "gpt-4" }` as the materialized value

### Dataflow Stream Materialization

When a dataflow carries a stream (rather than a materialized value), calling `dataflow.awaitStreamValue()` consumes the stream to completion:

```typescript
await dataflow.awaitStreamValue();
// After: dataflow.value contains the materialized port data
// After: dataflow.stream is cleared (set to undefined)
```

The method prioritizes events:

1. `snapshot` events: Use the last snapshot data
2. `finish` events: Use the finish data (which may include accumulated text from the source)
3. `text-delta` / `object-delta`: Ignored here (source task handles accumulation)

### Edge-Level Accumulation Detection

The `edgeNeedsAccumulation()` function determines whether a specific dataflow edge needs its source's stream to be accumulated:

```typescript
function edgeNeedsAccumulation(sourceSchema, sourcePort, targetSchema, targetPort): boolean {
  const sourceMode = getPortStreamMode(sourceSchema, sourcePort);
  if (sourceMode === "none") return false;
  const targetMode = getPortStreamMode(targetSchema, targetPort);
  return sourceMode !== targetMode;
}
```

If the source port streams in "append" mode but the target port does not declare "append" on its input, the edge needs accumulation to materialize the value.

---

## Cancel Semantics

Every task execution carries an `AbortSignal`. What happens when it fires, and what each task is responsible for, is defined here.

### Signal Origin and Propagation

Each `TaskRunner` owns an `AbortController`, created in `handleStart()` and wired into the task via `IExecuteContext.signal`:

```
┌─────────────────┐  AbortSignal   ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ TaskRunner      │ ─────────────> │ task.execute(input, ctx) │
│  AbortController│                │ task.executeStream(...)  │
└─────────────────┘                │    ctx.signal ───────────┼──> provider / fetch / SDK
                                   └──────────────────────────┘
```

- `taskRunner.abort()` calls `AbortController.abort()` on its own controller, and recursively aborts any owned subgraph (`task.subGraph.abort()`).
- Graph-level `graph.abort()` aborts every active task runner in the graph.
- Aborting an upstream task causes its dataflows to transition to `ABORTING` (the terminal aborted state); downstream tasks that have not yet started will never start.

### What Every Task MUST Do on Abort

1. **Either poll `context.signal.aborted`** at safe loop boundaries, **or forward `context.signal`** to any I/O it performs (fetch, SDK client, subprocess, child task).
2. **Stop producing output promptly.** A streaming task's generator must return (or throw) on the next `yield` point after abort, not continue producing events.
3. **Release resources.** Close readers, cancel timers, unregister listeners. A `try { ... } finally { ... }` block in an `async *executeStream()` generator is the idiomatic cleanup hook -- `finally` runs when the consumer stops iterating (including on abort).
4. **Throw `TaskAbortedError`** if the abort is detected inside `execute()` / `executeStream()`. The TaskRunner also detects abort on its own and converts it to a `TaskAbortedError` when the generator finishes after the signal fires, via the post-stream abort check in `TaskRunner.executeStreamingTask`.

Tasks **do not** need to manually set the task status -- the runner's `handleAbort()` transitions the task to `ABORTING` (the terminal aborted state) and attaches a `TaskAbortedError`.

### Partial-Result Contract

When a streaming task is aborted mid-stream:

- `task.runOutputData` **may contain partially accumulated data** (whatever text deltas or object deltas were received before the abort).
- `task.status` transitions to `ABORTING` (the terminal aborted state -- there is no separate `ABORTED` value).
- `task.error` is set to a `TaskAbortedError`.
- Downstream consumers **MUST treat `ABORTING` status as a failure**, not as a valid result, even if `runOutputData` looks superficially complete.

If you need guaranteed-complete results for a downstream computation, check `task.status === COMPLETED` before reading `runOutputData`.

### Downstream Propagation

When an upstream task aborts, the graph runner's behavior depends on the downstream task's current state:

| Downstream state | What happens                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`        | Task is never started. Its dataflows transition to `ABORTING`.                                                    |
| `PROCESSING`     | Receives abort via its own `AbortSignal` (which was derived from the graph). Task follows the normal cancel path. |
| `STREAMING`      | Receives an `error` `StreamEvent` on its input stream; runner throws `TaskAbortedError`.                          |
| `COMPLETED`      | No effect -- completed tasks are immutable.                                                                       |

### Per-Task JSDoc Convention

Any task overriding `executeStream()` (or `execute()` with non-trivial cancel behavior) **SHOULD** document its cancel contract in a `@cancel` JSDoc tag on the class or method. Minimum contents:

- What I/O or resources are opened during execution.
- What happens to partial state on abort (discarded, flushed, etc.).
- Whether side effects are reversible.

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Streams text from an HTTP endpoint.
 *
 * @cancel Forwards `context.signal` to the underlying `fetch`. On abort:
 * the HTTP connection is torn down by the browser/runtime, the reader is
 * released in the generator's `finally` block, and any partial text
 * accumulated on the task is discarded (status becomes `ABORTING`).
 * No side effects to clean up.
 */
async *executeStream(input, context): AsyncIterable<StreamEvent> { ... }
```

For provider stream functions (`AiProviderStreamFn`), the equivalent contract is documented on the function type itself -- signal forwarding to the underlying SDK is mandatory.

### Known Gaps

- **Per-provider cancel forwarding audit** -- most providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, llamacpp) rely on their SDK's handling of `AbortSignal`. A systematic audit confirming each SDK promptly stops yielding after abort is still open.
- **Bounded tee buffer** -- `ReadableStream.tee()` buffers for the slowest consumer with no cap. A `maxBufferedEvents` safety limit is a possible future hardening.

## Dataflow Event System

Dataflows emit events for lifecycle changes:

| Event       | Parameters   | Description                       |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `start`     | --           | Dataflow status set to PROCESSING |

### Subscribing to Dataflow Events

```typescript
const unsub = dataflow.subscribe("status", (status) => {
  console.log(`Dataflow ${dataflow.id}: ${status}`);
});

// One-time listener
dataflow.once("complete", () => {
  console.log(`Value: ${dataflow.value}`);
});

// Promise-based wait
await dataflow.waitOn("complete");
```

### Graph-Level Dataflow Subscription

```typescript
const unsub = graph.subscribeToDataflowStatus((dataflowId, status) => {
  console.log(`Dataflow ${dataflowId}: ${status}`);
});
```

## API Reference

### Dataflow Class

```typescript
class Dataflow {
  // Construction
  constructor(sourceTaskId, sourceTaskPortId, targetTaskId, targetTaskPortId);
  static createId(sourceTaskId, sourcePortId, targetTaskId, targetPortId): DataflowIdType;

  // Identity
  readonly id: DataflowIdType;
  sourceTaskId: TaskIdType;
  sourceTaskPortId: string;
  targetTaskId: TaskIdType;
  targetTaskPortId: string;

  // State
  value: any;
  status: TaskStatus;
  error: TaskError | undefined;
  stream: ReadableStream<StreamEvent> | undefined;

  // Value management
  setPortData(entireDataBlock: any): void;
  getPortData(): TaskOutput;
  setStatus(status: TaskStatus): void;
  reset(): void;

  // Stream management
  setStream(stream: ReadableStream<StreamEvent>): void;
  getStream(): ReadableStream<StreamEvent> | undefined;
  awaitStreamValue(): Promise<void>;

  // Compatibility
  semanticallyCompatible(graph, dataflow): "static" | "runtime" | "incompatible";
  invalidateCompatibilityCache(): void;

  // Events
  subscribe(event, callback): () => void;
  on(event, callback): void;
  off(event, callback): void;
  once(event, callback): void;
  waitOn(event): Promise<any>;
  emit(event, ...args): void;

  // Serialization
  toJSON(): DataflowJson;
}
```

### DataflowArrow Helper

For constructing dataflows from the string ID format:

```typescript
const dataflow = new DataflowArrow("taskA[result] ==> taskB[value]");
// Equivalent to: new Dataflow("taskA", "result", "taskB", "value")
```

### Stream Helper Functions

```typescript
// Get the stream mode of a specific port
function getPortStreamMode(schema: DataPortSchema, portId: string): StreamMode;

// Get all streaming ports with their modes
function getStreamingPorts(schema: DataPortSchema): Array<{ port: string; mode: StreamMode }>;

// Get the dominant output stream mode for a task
function getOutputStreamMode(outputSchema: DataPortSchema): StreamMode;

// Check if a task supports streaming execution
function isTaskStreamable(task: { outputSchema(); executeStream? }): boolean;

// Get the first append-mode port name
function getAppendPortId(schema: DataPortSchema): string | undefined;

// Get the first object-mode port name
function getObjectPortId(schema: DataPortSchema): string | undefined;

// Check if a dataflow edge needs value accumulation
function edgeNeedsAccumulation(sourceSchema, sourcePort, targetSchema, targetPort): boolean;

// Get schemas for structured output ports
function getStructuredOutputSchemas(schema: DataPortSchema): Map<string, JsonSchema>;

// Check if any port has structured output
function hasStructuredOutput(schema: DataPortSchema): boolean;
```

## Examples

### Basic Dataflow Wiring

```typescript
import { Task, TaskGraph, Dataflow } from "@workglow/task-graph";

const producer = new ProducerTask({ id: "producer" });
const consumer = new ConsumerTask({ id: "consumer" });

const graph = new TaskGraph();
graph.addTasks([producer, consumer]);
graph.addDataflow(new Dataflow("producer", "output", "consumer", "input"));

const results = await graph.run();
```

### Streaming AI Task

```typescript
class StreamingTextTask extends Task<{ prompt: string }, { text: string }> {
  static readonly type = "StreamingTextTask";
  static readonly cachePolicy = { kind: "none" } as const;

  static outputSchema(): DataPortSchema {
    return {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        text: {
          type: "string",
          "x-stream": "append", // Enable append-mode streaming
        },
      },
    } as const satisfies DataPortSchema;
  }

  async *executeStream(input, context): AsyncIterable<StreamEvent> {
    const response = await fetch("/api/generate", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: input.prompt }),
      signal: context.signal,
    });

    const reader = response.body!.getReader();
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();

    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;

      yield {
        type: "text-delta",
        port: "text",
        textDelta: decoder.decode(value),
      };
    }

    yield { type: "finish", data: {} as any };
  }
}
```

### Subscribing to Stream Events

```typescript
const graph = new TaskGraph();
// ... add streaming tasks ...

// Listen for streaming events at the graph level
const unsub = graph.subscribeToTaskStreaming({
  onStreamStart: (taskId) => {
    console.log(`Stream started: ${taskId}`);
    showSpinner(taskId);
  },
  onStreamChunk: (taskId, event) => {
    if (event.type === "text-delta") {
      appendToUI(taskId, event.textDelta);
    } else if (event.type === "object-delta") {
      updateStructuredView(taskId, event.objectDelta);
    }
  },
  onStreamEnd: (taskId, output) => {
    console.log(`Stream ended: ${taskId}`, output);
    hideSpinner(taskId);
  },
});

await graph.run({ prompt: "Explain quantum computing" });
unsub();
```

### Wildcard Port Dataflow

```typescript
// Pass entire output object as input using DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS
import { DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS } from "@workglow/task-graph";

graph.addDataflow(
  new Dataflow(
    "producer",
    DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS, // All output properties
    "consumer",
    DATAFLOW_ALL_PORTS // Spread into all input properties
  )
);
```

### Checking Port Compatibility

```typescript
const dataflow = new Dataflow("taskA", "text", "taskB", "input");
graph.addDataflow(dataflow);

const compat = dataflow.semanticallyCompatible(graph, dataflow);
if (compat === "incompatible") {
  console.warn(`Port types are incompatible: ${dataflow.id}`);
}
```

### Object Streaming for Structured Data

```typescript
class StructuredOutputTask extends Task<{ query: string }, { result: object }> {
  static outputSchema(): DataPortSchema {
    return {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        result: {
          type: "object",
          "x-stream": "object",
          "x-structured-output": true,
          properties: {
            name: { type: "string" },
            age: { type: "number" },
            skills: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
          },
        },
      },
    } as const satisfies DataPortSchema;
  }

  async *executeStream(input, context): AsyncIterable<StreamEvent> {
    // Simulate progressive object construction
    yield { type: "object-delta", port: "result", objectDelta: { name: "Alice" } };
    yield { type: "object-delta", port: "result", objectDelta: { name: "Alice", age: 30 } };
    yield {
      type: "object-delta",
      port: "result",
      objectDelta: { name: "Alice", age: 30, skills: ["TypeScript", "Rust"] },
    };
    yield { type: "finish", data: {} as any };
  }
}
```
