### Documentation

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- **refactor(task-graph)**: `TaskOutputRepository.getOutputStreamByRef` (and
  `getOutputStreamByRefForRun`) always return a Promise

  Both were declared as a tri-state union —
  `AsyncIterable<Uint8Array> | undefined | Promise<AsyncIterable<Uint8Array> | undefined>` —
  which does not compose with `StreamPortCodec.materialize`, whose parameter is the
  iterable alone. Every consumer had to decide for itself whether a given backing needed
  awaiting, and the tree had grown two narrowings of the one interface in opposite
  directions: the concrete repositories overrode it with the synchronous half, while the
  streaming contract helper declared its own Promise-only version.

  The union also made the await in `streamRefViaBacking` load-bearing by convention
  rather than by type. That await is what turns an asynchronous backing's dangling ref
  into `undefined` — a cache miss — instead of a truthy Promise a caller reads as a live
  stream, and nothing in the signature required it.

  Migration for an implementor: mark the method `async`. A backing that can answer
  synchronously still does; the cost is one microtask per ref, not per chunk. Callers
  that were relying on the synchronous return must `await` it — including in assertions,
  where `expect(repo.getOutputStreamByRef(ref)).toBeDefined()` previously passed for a
  dangling ref, because a Promise is always defined.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CachePolicy` discriminated union (`deterministic` / `private` / `none`) declared via static `Task.cachePolicy` or instance `getCachePolicy(inputs)` override for input-dependent policies.
- `Task.version` static + `getCacheVersion()` for explicit cache invalidation. Bumping the version invalidates cached outputs.
- `CacheRegistry` service registered under `CACHE_REGISTRY` token with two optional slots (`deterministic`, `private`). Missing slot = no-op caching.
- `RunPrivateCacheRepo` namespacing wrapper keyed by `runId`. `TaskGraphRunner` builds this automatically when `runId` is supplied in run config.
- `CacheJanitor.sweepStaleRunPrivate(olderThanMs)` for app-scheduled cleanup of crashed-run cache rows.
- New abstract methods on `TaskOutputRepository`: `isDurable()`, `deleteByTaskTypePrefix()`, `clearOlderThanWithTaskTypePrefix()`, `sizeByTaskTypePrefix()`. `TaskOutputTabularRepository` provides default implementations via row iteration.

### Changed

- `TaskRunner` resolves the per-task cache via `CACHE_REGISTRY` in the `ServiceRegistry` and routes by `getCachePolicy(inputs)`. Legacy `config.outputCache: TaskOutputRepository` still works as a back-compat shim mapped to the `deterministic` slot.
- `TaskGraphRunner` threads `runId` through `IExecuteContext`. Throws `TaskConfigurationError` if a graph contains a `private`-policy task but no `runId` is provided. Awaits `clearRun()` on successful completion; failed/aborted runs leave entries for restart or TTL sweep.
- Cache key now includes the task's `cacheVersion` via a reserved `__cv` sentinel injected into normalized inputs. Tasks may not declare an input port named `__cv` (rejected at construction).
- `AiImageOutputTask` now routes to `private` when no `seed` is supplied (was: uncached) and `deterministic` when seeded.
- Telemetry span attribute renamed from `workglow.task.cacheable` (boolean) to `workglow.task.cache_policy` (string) and is now set after policy resolution, so input-dependent policies report the correct value.

### Deprecated

- `static cacheable: boolean` on Task subclasses. Use `static cachePolicy: CachePolicy = { kind: "none" | "deterministic" | "private" }` instead. The boolean shim emits a one-shot warning per task type and will be removed in a future release.
- `ITaskStaticProperties.cacheable` interface field marked `@deprecated`. The interface now declares the optional `cachePolicy` field as the canonical replacement.

### Migration

- Replace `static cacheable = false` with `static cachePolicy: CachePolicy = { kind: "none" }`.
- Replace any `outputCache: someRepo` run-config use with registering a `CacheRegistry` instance in `ServiceRegistry`:
  ```ts
  services.registerInstance(CACHE_REGISTRY, new DefaultCacheRegistry({ deterministic: repo }));
  ```
- Provide a `runId` in `IRunConfig` when running graphs with `private`-policy tasks (caller-supplied; typically a UUID matching a DB row).
