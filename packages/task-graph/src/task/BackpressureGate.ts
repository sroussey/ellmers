/**
 * Cost-agnostic park/wake primitive for producer/consumer backpressure.
 *
 * A producer calls {@link charge} with the cost of the item it just handed to
 * a buffer; the returned promise resolves immediately while buffered cost is
 * under the high-water mark and otherwise **parks** until a consumer has
 * {@link credit}ed enough cost back to drop below the mark. {@link close} and
 * {@link fail} release every parked producer so an aborted or errored stream
 * never orphans a waiter.
 *
 * The gate owns only the accounting and the wake signal — it does not hold the
 * buffered items themselves. The "cost" unit is whatever the caller charges
 * (bytes for binary chunks, UTF-8 length for text, a per-delta unit for
 * objects), so one gate serves every stream mode.
