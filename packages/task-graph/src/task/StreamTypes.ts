 * at different rates; a counter sharing a rate with its parent is a labelled

 *
 * - `input` / `output` — prompt and completion tokens.
 * - `cached` — prompt tokens served from a provider-side cache (read).
 * - `cacheWrite` — prompt tokens written into that cache.
 * - `input`, `cached` and `cacheWrite` are **disjoint**: `input` is the portion
 *   billed at the base input rate and never includes cache reads or writes, so
 *   `input + cached + cacheWrite` is the full prompt. Providers reporting a
 *   grand total plus a breakdown line are normalized by subtraction.
 * - `reasoning` — output tokens spent on hidden reasoning, when reported
 *   separately. **`output` includes `reasoning`**: no provider charges a
 *   distinct reasoning rate, so it is a visibility breakdown of `output`, not a
 *   sibling of it. Providers reporting them disjointly are normalized by
 *   addition.
 * - `total` — the provider's own total, when it reports one. Never synthesized.
 *   When present it satisfies `input + cached + cacheWrite + output === total`.
 * - `extra` — provider-specific counters that have no normalized slot.
 *
 * **Subtract only what the provider stated.** When `cached` is unreported,
 * `input` remains the provider's stated prompt total and `cached` stays
 * `undefined`; the disjointness invariant holds vacuously under uncertainty
 * rather than being enforced by a guess.
