 * execution rather than per event — a streaming task emitting dozens of
 * snapshots still writes once. Nothing is recorded unless a caller attaches
 * this; the graph itself only emits.
 *
 * The returned detach awaits writes still in flight, so a caller that tears
 * down at run end does not lose the last rows. A checkpoint's storage charge is
 * only known when the run's ResourceScope disposes it, so detach AFTER that
 * disposal: `runGraph` awaits it before resolving when it owns the scope, but a
 * caller-owned scope must be disposed by the caller first or its row is lost.
