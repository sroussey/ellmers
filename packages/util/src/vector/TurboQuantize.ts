/**
 * Vector quantization by randomized rotation plus uniform scalar quantization.
 *
 * Inspired by "TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate"
 * by Zandieh, Daliri, Hadian, and Mirrokni (2025).
 *
 * Why rotate: a random orthogonal rotation spreads a vector's energy evenly over its
 * coordinates, so no coordinate dominates and every coordinate ends up with the same
 * approximately Gaussian marginal. One fixed quantization grid then fits every
 * coordinate of every vector, with no training pass and no per-dataset codebook.
 *
 * What this module implements: the randomized Hadamard rotation, plus a UNIFORM scalar
 * quantizer whose clipping range is the MSE-optimal loading factor for a unit-variance
 * Gaussian at the given bit width. Reconstruction is renormalized back to the recorded
 * L2 norm, which keeps reconstructed magnitude and the similarity estimates unbiased.
 *
 * What it does NOT implement: the paper's non-uniform, distribution-fitted (Beta) level
 * placement. Distortion here is that of an optimal *uniform* quantizer, which is coarser
 * than the paper's near-optimal one.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - Data-oblivious: no training or codebook construction needed
 * - Per-vector: each vector quantized independently (streaming-friendly)
 * - Preserves inner products and cosine similarity for similarity search

/**
 * Quantizes a vector using TurboQuant rotation directly into a byte-aligned TypedArray.
 *
 * Unlike the packed `turboQuantize`, this outputs a standard TypedArray (Int8Array or
 * Int16Array) with the **same `.length`** as the input vector, so it drops into
 * storage backends that expect a fixed-width vector column.
 *
 * ## Signed targets only
 *
 * Only `int8` and `int16` are supported. An unsigned target would need the affine
 * map `x -> (x + scale) / (2 * scale) * max`, whose DC offset (127.5 for uint8)
 * lands on every stored coordinate. Cosine similarity is invariant to scaling but
 * NOT to translation, so that shared component dominates the result: measured at
 * d=1024 / uint8 / seed 42, a true cosine of 0.0559 reads 0.9071 and the whole
 * range collapses to roughly [0.90, 1.00] — negatives become impossible and
 * absolute thresholds meaningless. The offset cannot be subtracted back out at
 * comparison time either: `cosineSimilarity(a, b)` receives only the two arrays,
 * and pgvector / SQLite / DuckDB compute the distance server-side. Unsigned also
 * buys no storage over the signed type of the same width.
 *
 * ## Comparability
 *
 * The output is cosine-comparable ONLY against other outputs of this function
 * produced with the SAME seed. It is not comparable with the unrotated input
 * vector, nor with linearly quantized vectors, nor across seeds — the rotation is
 * a per-seed change of basis, so mixing them yields meaningless rankings with no
 * error raised anywhere.
 *
 * ## Power-of-2 dimensions required, or opt into padding
 *
 * The rotation operates on `nextPowerOf2(d)` coordinates, so a non-power-of-2 `d` has to
 * either widen the output or discard coordinates. This function does the first on request
 * and never the second.
 *
 * Pass `{ padToPowerOf2: true }` to receive a `nextPowerOf2(d)`-length result. Padding
 * keeps the transform orthogonal, and at that width TurboQuant is the more accurate
 * choice by a wide margin — cosine RMSE against the exact similarity (int8, seed 42, 40
 * seeded pairs), padded turbo vs linear quantization: 0.00034 vs 0.00269 at d=768
 * (MiniLM), 0.00024 vs 0.00331 at d=1536, 0.00021 vs 0.00263 at d=3072. The cost is
 * purely the width: the output is LONGER than the input, so a fixed-width storage column
 * must be declared at the padded width.
 *
 * Without that option a non-power-of-2 `d` is rejected rather than silently degraded. The
 * rejected alternative is CROPPING — keeping the first `d` of the rotated coordinates —
 * which makes this a lossy random projection rather than an orthogonal rotation and
 * measures worse than plain linear quantization at exactly the sizes real embedding
 * models use: cropped turbo vs linear, 0.0164 vs 0.0027 at d=768, 0.0126 vs 0.0033 at
 * d=1536, 0.0094 vs 0.0026 at d=3072. Those cropped figures are recorded here only to
 * explain why the variant is not offered; this function no longer emits it, so do not
 * quote them as the cost of turbo at these dimensionalities — padding is.
 *
 * {@link turboQuantize} is unaffected either way: it keeps all `paddedLen` coordinates
 * and stays fully invertible at any dimensionality.
 *
 * Note: The vector norm is not preserved (cosine similarity is scale-invariant,
 * so this is fine for similarity search).
 *
 * @param vector - Input vector (any TypedArray). Must not contain NaN or Infinity.
 * @param targetType - Target signed integer type (INT8 or INT16)
