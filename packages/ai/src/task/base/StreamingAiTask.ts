/**
 * A base class for streaming AI tasks.
 * Extends AiTask to provide streaming output via executeStream().
 *
 * Subclasses set `streamMode` to control streaming behavior:
 * - 'append': each chunk is a delta (e.g., a new token). Default for text generation.
 * - 'object': each chunk is a progressively more complete partial object.
 * - 'replace': each chunk is a revised full snapshot of the output.
 *
 * The standard execute() method is preserved as a fallback that internally
 * consumes the stream to completion (so non-streaming callers get the same result).
 *
 * Port annotation: providers yield raw events without a `port` field.
 * This class wraps text-delta events with the correct port from the task's
 * output schema before they reach the TaskRunner.
 *
 * @cancel The `context.signal` is forwarded to the resolved execution strategy
 * (direct or queued), which in turn forwards it to the provider stream function.
 * When the signal fires, the underlying provider SDK tears down its connection
 * and the inner `for await` exits; this generator then returns or throws
 * promptly. Consumer-driven cancellation (an early `break` from the
 * `for await` consuming this generator) is also propagated: see
 * {@link runWithIterable} for the mechanism that converts a closed
 * consumer into an aborted provider signal. Partial accumulated text /
 * object state may still remain in task or runner state after abort (the
 * runner does not clear `runOutputData`) and MUST be treated as invalid
 * unless the final run status is `COMPLETED`. Subclasses overriding
 * `executeStream()` MUST preserve this contract: forward `context.signal`,
 * and either return or throw promptly after abort.
