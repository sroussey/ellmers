 * the key and reads back `undefined` — so a strict `===` matched nothing for
 * exactly the rows the caller was asking for.
 *
 * That mattered well beyond a missing row. A repo doing "look up by tuple, else
 * create" never found its own row when any column in the tuple was null, so it
 * created a duplicate on every call; the in-memory backend agreed with the
 * broken SQL behavior, so tests could not see it.
 *
 * **`undefined` is not `null`, and matches nothing.** A criterion of
 * `undefined` — what a spread optional filter leaves behind, `{ ...maybe }`
 * where `maybe` is `{ col: undefined }` — gets no `IS NULL` rewrite, because a
 * key present with no value cannot be told apart from a filter the caller
 * meant to omit, and guessing would trade a visible bug for an invisible one.
 * So it stays an ordinary equality, the SQL backends bind it as NULL, and
 * `col = NULL` is never true: no row matches, on any backend. The early return
 * here is what makes that true off SQL as well — read as a plain `===` this
 * matched rows whose column was absent, which is the answer no database gives.
 *
 * The consequence is worth stating plainly, because it is silent: a criteria
 * bag built by spreading an optional filter returns zero rows rather than

   *
   * **What the fallback reads.** The single-statement path is bounded by the
   * database. The hash join is not, by default: `limit` and `offset` are
   * applied to the joined rows, so a bounded join can still be a whole-table
   * read. It bounds the left read — and stops early — only when the joined
   * rows come back in their final order, meaning `orderBy` is absent or names
   * only left columns the left query can order by. An `orderBy` touching the
   * right side, or a left column that may be null, is sorted in memory
   * instead, and that sort needs every joined row: such a join reads the whole
   * left table and every right row matching it, however small its `limit`.
   * Over a remote backend (HTTP proxy, Supabase) that is the whole table on
   * the wire, so prefer a `where.left` that narrows it, or an `orderBy` the
   * left side can serve.

  /**
   * Runs `fn` inside a single transaction. If `fn` throws, all writes performed
   * inside it are rolled back; otherwise they commit atomically. Mutation
   * events (e.g. `put`) emitted inside `fn` are buffered and delivered after
   * the transaction commits, so listeners never observe rows that are about
   * to roll back.
   *
   * Backends differ in how strong the guarantee is:
   *   - **SQLite**: real `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`.
   *   - **PostgreSQL**: real `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`. On a real
   *     `pg.Pool` (anything exposing `connect()`) the implementation
   *     dedicates a client via `pool.connect()` and runs the transaction on
   *     that client, leaving the parent's pool free for external traffic
   *     in parallel. On single-connection wrappers (PGLitePool, raw PGlite)
   *     the transaction runs on the shared session and concurrent calls on
   *     the same instance are serialized behind a per-instance mutex so
   *     they cannot slip into the open transaction.
   *   - **Supabase, in-memory, file system, IndexedDB**: best-effort. The
   *     callback runs to completion and rejection propagates, but partial
   *     writes are not rolled back because the backend does not expose a
   *     transaction surface usable by this API.
   *
   * **Concurrency contract:**
   *   - On backends with native transaction support (SQLite, PostgreSQL),
   *     concurrent calls on the same storage instance are isolated from the
   *     open transaction: SQLite and the single-connection Postgres path
   *     serialize them through a per-instance mutex; the real-pool Postgres
   *     path runs them on independent pool clients in parallel. Either way,
   *     unrelated writes never accidentally commit or roll back along with
   *     `fn`.
   *   - On best-effort backends concurrent writes have no atomicity barrier
   *     to begin with — the contract on those backends is "runs `fn`", not
   *     "isolates `fn`".
   *
   * The `tx` handle passed to `fn` is **not** the same object as `this` for
   * backends with native transaction support — it is a Proxy that routes
   * writes through the transaction-bound resources (the dedicated client on
   * real `pg.Pool`, the bypass-mutex internal methods on SQLite/PGlite) and
   * routes events through the transaction's deferred-emit queue. Callers
   * MUST use `tx` for everything inside `fn`. Capturing the outer `this` and
   * calling methods on it from inside `fn` will deadlock against the held
   * mutex (single-connection backends) or run on the wrong connection
   * (`pg.Pool`), and is unsupported.
   *
   * **Nested calls.** Calls made through the `tx` handle always throw —
   * `tx.withTransaction(...)` is a hard error on every backend. Calls made
   * through the *original* (captured `this`) handle behave per backend:
   *   - **SQLite, single-connection Postgres** (PGlite, PGLitePool): throw,
   *     because the backend has no autonomous `BEGIN` and reusing the open
   *     transaction implicitly would be ambiguous.
   *   - **Real `pg.Pool` Postgres**: acquire an *independent* client and run
   *     as an *independent* transaction with its own commit/rollback boundary.
   *     This is the natural Postgres concurrency model on a pool — nothing
   *     ties the two transactions together. If you want the inner work to
   *     roll back when the outer throws, do not use a captured `this`; use
   *     `tx` (which throws) and a SAVEPOINT instead.
   *
   * Use SAVEPOINT directly if you need nested rollback boundaries within a
   * single logical transaction.
   *
   * To commit writes across several storages that share one connection, use
   * the free function `withConnectionTransaction(participants, fn)` instead
   * of nesting `withTransaction` calls. Inside that callback, call ordinary
   * methods on the original instances (there is no `tx` proxy).
