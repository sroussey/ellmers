 * siblings added alongside it.
 *
 * That distinction is not cosmetic. The mapper subtracts both from
 * `input_tokens` to produce the disjoint base-rate `input` bucket, so if either
 * were additive every cached call would under-report its base-rate prompt by
 * the size of the cache hit — and a cost estimate built on it would be wrong by
