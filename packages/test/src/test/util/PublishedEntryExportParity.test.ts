 *
 * Why names, and why both sides: a bundle that lost a re-export still resolves
 * and still evaluates cleanly, so `PublishedEntryImports.test.ts`'s "loads and
 * exports something" check passes over it unchanged. That test's `> 0` bound is
 * satisfied by a bundle carrying one symbol out of ninety. The export list is
 * the only observable that says the entry point is intact, and the source file
 * is the only available statement of what it should be.
 *
 * Under the default `source` target the source-resolving plugin rewrites
 * `import(specifier)` to exactly the path `sourceCounterpart()` computes, so
 * both sides ARE the same module and every case asserts `X === X`. Those cases
 * are therefore SKIPPED under source, so the report distinguishes "checked"
 * from "not applicable" rather than showing ~90 green rows that compared
 * nothing. The run that means something is `test-vitest-dist`
 * (`WORKGLOW_TEST_TARGET=dist`), where the left side is the real bundle; hence
 * a unit-tier file, since that is the tier the dist job runs.
 *
 * Skipping loses no loading: `PublishedEntryImports.test.ts` imports every
 * published specifier unconditionally, and that file DOES carry signal under
 * source — it is what proves each entry resolves and evaluates at all.
