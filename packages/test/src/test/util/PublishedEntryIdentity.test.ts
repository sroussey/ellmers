 * What this file is actually checking, and why the obvious version of it is

 *
 * The failure mode is CLASS identity across bundle boundaries, exactly as
 * `packages/task-graph/src/test-entry.ts` documents it. `registerAnthropicInline`
 * constructs `new AnthropicQueuedProvider(...)` from a RELATIVE import inside the
 * `ai-runtime` module graph, while that class extends a base built from
 * `AiProvider` imported BY SPECIFIER. Inline `@workglow/ai` into
 * `ai-runtime.js` — a bundler flag, a dropped `external`, a re-export rewritten
 * from `export *` to `export { … } from` — and the constructed instance stops
 * being `instanceof` the `AiProvider` every consumer holds, while every
 * existing check stays green.
 *
 * Asserting on the SERVICE REGISTRY instead would prove nothing: the global DI
 * container is stashed on `Symbol.for("@workglow/util/di/globalContainer")`
 * (`packages/util/src/di/Container.ts`) precisely so duplicated bundle copies
 * share one instance, and `createServiceToken` returns a plain string id. A
 * duplicated `@workglow/ai` therefore resolves the SAME registry, and a `===`
 * assertion on it is green by construction.
 *
 * Under the default `source` target this file passes trivially — every
 * specifier resolves to `src`, so there is only ever one copy of every class. A
 * green source run is therefore NOT a bundle check. The run that means
 * something is `test-vitest-dist` (`WORKGLOW_TEST_TARGET=dist`), which is why
 * this is a unit-tier file: that is the tier the dist job runs.
 *
 * It is affordable there because `register*Inline` needs NO API key. It
 * constructs the provider and calls `registerProviderInline`, which calls
 * `provider.register(...)` — registry bookkeeping and a strategy resolver, no
 * network. Putting this on an integration tier instead would have cost real
 * money for no extra signal, and would have been skipped entirely on fork PRs,
 * where the secrets those suites gate on are unavailable.
