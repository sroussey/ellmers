 * dropped a re-export from either bundle would have left the file in place,
 * satisfied every existing check, and broken consumers only after publish.
 *
 * Enumerating the manifests instead of the import graph makes the check TOTAL
 * rather than tier-shaped, and it costs nothing under the default target (the
 * same source files the rest of the suite already loads). It is a unit-tier
 * file on purpose: that is the tier `test-vitest-dist` runs.
 *

 * `packages/test` is a `composite` project rooted at `./src`, so importing from
