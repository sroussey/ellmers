# Contract Conformance Suites

Parameterized test suites that exercise an interface contract against
every adapter that implements it. Each suite exports one function:

    export function runXxxConformance(opts: { factory, capabilities, ... }): void;

An adapter writes a thin caller that supplies a factory and capability flags;
all behavioral assertions are inherited.

## Why a separate directory

`packages/test/src/contract/` contains only parameterized suites. Concrete
test files (`*.test.ts`) live under `packages/test/src/test/`. This boundary
makes the pattern obvious: anything in `contract/` is reusable; nothing here
runs on its own.

Two pre-existing parameterized suites live with their concrete callers and
stay in place — moving them is unnecessary churn:

- `packages/test/src/test/job-queue/genericJobQueueTests.ts`
- `packages/test/src/test/storage-tabular/genericTabularStorageTests.ts`

Treat both as additional examples of the pattern.

## Conventions

1.  **Entrypoint shape.**

        export function runXxxConformance(opts: {
          readonly name: string;
          readonly skip?: boolean;
          readonly timeout: number;
          readonly factory: () => Promise<{ register, dispose, inspect }>;
          readonly capabilities: Record<string, boolean>;
          // ...contract-specific fields
        }): void;

    Defines a single top-level `describe.skipIf(opts.skip)`.

2.  **Factory shape.** `factory()` returns a fresh handle per top-level
    `beforeAll`. The handle exposes:
    - `register()` — install the provider/storage/queue and any model records.
    - `dispose()` — release resources; called in `afterAll`.
    - `inspect()` — optional whitebox handle for assertions that need to
      observe internal state (session maps, disposable refs). Adapters that
      don't expose internals return `{}`; assertions skip with a logged
      warning instead of passing silently.

3.  **Capability flags drive `describe.skipIf(!cap)` blocks.** Never silently
    skip on missing capability without a flag — the absence of a flag
    indicates a contract gap, not a permitted variation.

4.  **Live-API tests honor existing preload + retry/timeout settings.** Do
    not introduce new env vars from a contract suite.

5.  **Adapter shims are short.** A new adapter joining a contract suite
    should be ~30 lines: imports, factory, capability flags, model IDs.

6.  **`dispose()` must be idempotent.** Conformance suites may call dispose
    multiple times (once for the dispose assertion, once in `afterAll`).
    Adapters whose underlying resource doesn't natively support repeated
    dispose should guard with a flag.

### Factory shape variants

The `register/dispose/inspect` factory documented above is one of two
legitimate shapes — used when an adapter is a long-lived global registration
(e.g. an AI provider). For contracts whose subject is heavyweight but
per-test state (e.g. browser contexts), prefer a `create/dispose` factory
where each top-level block instantiates its own subject:

    factory: () => Promise<{
      create: () => Promise<TSubject>;
      dispose: (subject: TSubject) => Promise<void>;
    }>

The principle is the same: a fresh handle per block, with no shared state
that block N can leak into block N+1. The methods on the handle are
contract-specific.

## Worker-proxy pattern

Workers cross a `postMessage` boundary; the inline AiProvider conformance
assertions must also hold when a provider is registered via
`register({ worker })`. Each worker-capable adapter's shim invokes the suite
**three times**:

1. `runAiProviderConformance({ name: "<Adapter> (inline)", factory: inlineFactory, ... })`
2. `runAiProviderConformance({ name: "<Adapter> (worker)", factory: workerFactory, ... })`
3. `runWorkerProxyBoundary({ name: "<Adapter>", factory: workerFactory, ... })`

The worker factory's `inspect()` returns `{}` — workers are opaque by
design. The inherited session-reuse and dispose blocks skip with their
existing logged-warning behavior; the boundary block adds three
worker-only assertions (dispose terminates worker, worker-side throw
surfaces with stack, postMessage handles concurrent streams independently).

Capability flags:

- `browserOnly: true` — entire boundary block emits a single skipped test.
  Used for TF-MediaPipe until browser test infra arrives.
- `errorPropagation: false` — relaxes the throw-surfaces assertion to skip
  the stack-frame check, asserting only a non-empty message.

## Billing failures: skipped on CI, failed locally

Live provider suites run against real accounts, so "we ran out of money" is a
condition every one of them can hit. `contract/creditExhaustedSkip.ts` detects
it — 402s, `insufficient_quota`, `insufficient_credits`, DeepSeek's
`Insufficient Balance`, Anthropic's credit-balance error — and the `it` exported
from that module (which every conformance assertion imports) decides what to do
with it:

| where         | behavior | why                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CI            | skip     | nobody watching a build can top an account up, and one exhausted key would turn every provider suite red for a change that touched no provider |
| anywhere else | fail     | the developer running the suite IS the person who can act on it                                                                                |

`CI` / `GITHUB_ACTIONS` select the branch; `WORKGLOW_CREDIT_EXHAUSTED_SKIP=1`
forces the skip locally and `=0` forces the failure on CI.

The detector reads the **message** as well as the numeric status, and that is
load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces: `classifyProviderError` rebuilds a
provider error as a `PermanentJobError` carrying the message and neither
`status` nor `cause`, so by the time a test body catches a DeepSeek 402 the
number survives only as the `402 Insufficient Balance` text the OpenAI SDK put
in the message. A status-only detector reads that as an ordinary permanent
failure — which is exactly how DeepSeek kept failing suites while every other
provider skipped. Message matching for a bare `402` is anchored to an
HTTP-shaped position (line start, or after a summary line's colon) so prose
that merely contains the number is not scavenged as a status.

Rate limits (429 + `rate_limit_exceeded`) are deliberately NOT this: they are
transient and the retry policy handles them.

## How to add a new contract suite

1. Pick a contract surface (an interface or abstract base class).
2. Enumerate the behavioral invariants the contract implies but that aren't
   currently asserted in any concrete test.
3. Decide the capability matrix — which assertions are universal, which
   are opt-in.
4. Create `packages/test/src/contract/<contract-name>/` with `types.ts`,
   `fixtures.ts`, `run<Contract>Conformance.ts`, and per-assertion files
   under `assertions/`.
5. Write one shim caller per adapter under
   `packages/test/src/test/<contract-name>/<Adapter>_Generic.integration.test.ts`.
6. Add a row to the table above.

## Roadmap

Future contract suites in priority order:

1. Storage extensions (subscribeToChanges ordering, vector-dimension format,
   putBulk round-trip count, deleteSearch streaming) — additions to the
   existing `genericTabularStorageTests.ts`.
2. Worker-proxy contract — harness shipped; per-adapter wiring deferred to a
   follow-up PR (vitest-Node `Worker` polyfill + per-adapter
   `WorkerManager` unregister-on-dispose required before HFT/LlamaCpp can
   register inline + worker in the same test file).
3. `IBrowserContext` — Playwright / Electron / BunWebView / CDP backends.
4. `EntitlementProfile` — desktop / web / server profiles.
5. `IHumanConnector` — IN PROGRESS — `MockHumanConnector` + `McpElicitationConnector`. App / Electron adapters add their own shim when introduced.
