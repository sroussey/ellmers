 * prefix cannot tell them apart, so the exemption is spelled out to the closing
 * `>`: `[^<>^|]*` on the third field admits no further `^`, so a token carrying
 * an `optional_link` fails to match and is escaped like any other broadcast.
 *
 * Everything about it fails closed. A case variant (`<!DATE^`), a non-numeric
 * timestamp, and a fallback containing a `<` all fail the match, so a token
 * whose shape cannot be fully verified is escaped WHOLE rather than exempted
 * with something unverified inside it.
 *

/**
 * Neutralizes channel-wide broadcasts inside a Block Kit structure, so `text`
 * and `blocks` share one rule rather than two.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because Slack has two ways to say the same thing.
 *
 * 1. LEXICAL — {@link neutralizeSlackBroadcasts} on EVERY string leaf, not just
 *    the ones that render as message body. A non-date `<!` is a broadcast sigil
 *    wherever Slack finds it and has no legitimate occurrence in a `type`,
 *    `block_id`, `action_id` or URL field, so escaping all of them is
 *    side-effect-free — it covers `fields[]`, `elements[]`, accessories and
 *    header/context blocks without enumerating them, and cannot miss a block
 *    SHAPE Slack adds later. Calling that one function is also what carries the
 *    date-token exemption to every leaf, rather than a second copy of the rule.
 *
 * 2. STRUCTURAL — a `rich_text` message says `@channel` with
 *    `{type: "broadcast", range: "channel"}` and a group ping with
 *    `{type: "usergroup", usergroup_id: "S…"}`. There is no `<!` anywhere in
 *    either, so escaping string leaves leaves both fully live. Such an element
 *    is REWRITTEN to a plain text node rather than deleted: dropping it can
 *    leave an `elements[]` empty, which Slack rejects — turning a security
 *    control into an availability bug. The replacement text is literal
 *    (`@channel`), and `link_names: false` is already sent whenever mentions are
 *    disallowed, so it cannot auto-link.
 *
 * Matching on `type` alone rather than on `rich_text` ancestry is deliberate:
 * the only false positive is a caller who wanted a live usergroup ping, which is
 * exactly what this control exists to stop.
 *
 * Residual: a NEW structural notification element type Slack introduces later is
 * uncovered until it is added to {@link STRUCTURAL_BROADCAST_TYPES}. Unlike the
 * lexical half, this one cannot be shape-agnostic — a structural broadcast is
 * identified by nothing but its type name.
 *
 * 3. MARKUP — {@link stripSlackLinkLabels}, under `policy.stripLabels`. This one
 *    is a POLICY rather than an unconditional rule because it is the weaker
 *    remedy chosen for this walk specifically: `text` gets full entity escaping
 *    and `blocks` cannot, since the same traversal that reaches a `text` leaf
 *    also reaches a `url` leaf, where escaping `&` would corrupt a query string.
 *    The policy is required at every call site rather than defaulted — which of
 *    the two markup regimes a payload is under is exactly the thing a reader
 *    needs to see at the call.
 *
 * 4. STRUCTURAL MARKUP — {@link reduceStructuralLink}, under the SAME
 *    `policy.stripLabels`, because Block Kit expresses a masked link
 *    structurally as well as lexically: a destination field beside a label
 *    field has no `<` for rule 3 to match. The two remedies are the same
 *    remedy — keep the destination, drop the label — so one flag governs both.
 *    Within a recognized property PAIR the rule is shape-driven, so it reaches
 *    an overflow `option` that carries no `type` discriminator at all.
 *
 *    Residuals, all accepted: a url/label pair Slack adds later is uncovered
 *    until it joins {@link MASKED_LINK_PAIRS}, which is the price of not
 *    sweeping in `image_url` (an `image` block legitimately pairs it with a
 *    `title`, so a wildcard would rewrite a caption to its own CDN URL). And a
 *    `video` block additionally requires `links.embed:write` plus a registered
 *    unfurl domain, so an incoming webhook may be rejected with
 *    `invalid_blocks` before the pair ever renders — unverified either way, and
 *    not a reason to leave the shape uncovered.
 *
 * Order within a leaf: the broadcast escape runs FIRST. Reversed, a masked link
 * whose label contains a broadcast (`<https://x/|<!channel>>`) survives —
 * `MASKED_LINK` cannot match across the inner `<`, so nothing is stripped, and
 * the label is then merely escaped and left in place as a live link.
 *
 * New structures are returned; the input may be edge-owned and is never
 * mutated. Depth is capped rather than cycle-tracked: a cycle is infinitely
 * deep, so the cap terminates it, and the permanent configuration error that
 * results is exactly what a cyclic payload already produces a moment later when
 * the request body is serialized.
