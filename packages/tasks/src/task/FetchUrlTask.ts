 * subscribers still forfeits its mid-body retry budget. That is the deliberate
 * direction: the alternative is counting live subscribers, and a subscription
 * that arrives between the check and the emit turns a correct retry into a
 * concatenated body. The inline path, where the context genuinely carries no

   * before any delta is emitted and no downstream consumer is ever dispatched
   * on a doomed fetch.
   *
   * This both calls `context.emitStreamEvent` AND `yield`s every `body`
   * delta. A caller must pick exactly one delivery path: a job context whose
   * `emitStreamEvent` fans out to the same listeners that also drain this
   * generator's yields would double-ship every chunk. The inline `execute()`
   * below is safe because it only drains yields (its context carries no
   * `emitStreamEvent`); a future queued-source caller wiring a worker context
   * through here needs to route through one path, not both.
   *
   * The emitted terminal `finish` is the stream's end-of-stream marker, and
   * awaiting it is what makes it one — by ordering, not by delivery. On the
   * awaited fast path the await covers the dispatch to attached listeners; on
   * the channel path (where that fast path is suppressed and the reassembler's
   * own dispatch is deliberately unawaited) it covers the durable write, which
   * fixes the marker's seq after the last delta's. Nothing can overtake it on
   * either carrier. That is the signal {@link FetchUrlTask.consumeJobStream}
   * ends on, instead of guessing from the job's completion that no more bytes
   * are coming. It
   * carries only `metadata`: the derived port is the *value*, which the
   * settled job output already carries, and duplicating a whole body into the
   * carrier's stream log (where a transferable buffer may be detached out from
   * under the job that still has to return it) buys nothing.

  /**
   * Adapts `handle.onStream`'s pushed callbacks into the pulled async iterable
   * `executeStream` has to be.
   *
   * **Where the listener promise actually paces the worker.** It resolves only
   * once the event it carried has been pulled off this generator, and on the
   * channel-less fast path that reaches the producer: `JobQueueClient`'s
   * `handleJobStream` awaits every listener, the worker awaits that dispatch,
   * and a slow sink therefore parks the job mid-body. When a stream *channel*
   * subscription is open for the job the fast path is suppressed and the
   * channel replays the row with its dispatch deliberately unawaited (the
   * event is already durably published, so on a cross-process carrier there is
   * no live producer left to pace) — nothing on that path observes this
   * promise, so the worker runs ahead of the consumer no matter what this
   * method does.
   *
   * Nothing here bounds what a fire-and-forget carrier can hand over: the
   * events it has already delivered sit in `pending`, and its own log holds
   * whatever it published. Backpressure across the job boundary exists only
   * where the dispatch is awaited, and no queue this side keeps can create it.
   *
   * **What ends the loop.** `FetchUrlJob` emits a terminal `finish` and awaits
   * it. That await buys ordering rather than delivery: on the fast path it
   * covers the dispatch to attached listeners, and on the channel path the
   * durable write, which fixes the marker's seq after the last delta's. Either
   * way nothing can overtake it, so a marker arriving here means every delta
   * ahead of it already did — the body is whole. The loop ends there. The job's
   * settled output remains the authority for the *value*, so the marker is
   * released without being re-yielded: `waitFor()` produces the one `finish`,
   * and the two can never disagree or arrive twice.
   *
   * Settlement is the fallback for a stream that produces no marker — a failed
   * job (`waitFor()` rejects and there is nothing more to wait for), or a
   * carrier that dropped the terminal row. Because the completion signal and
   * the stream are independent transports, ending there immediately would drop
   * an event still in flight, which on a body port is silent truncation. So a
   * settled stream keeps taking turns of the event loop for as long as each
   * turn actually drains something, and ends on the first turn that does not.
   * A residual remains for that fallback alone: an event landing more than one
   * idle turn after the last, on a carrier that does not deliver the marker
   * *within that turn*, is still lost. Delivering both a moment after the
   * grace turn is spent does not save it — the loop is already gone, so the
   * marker has nothing left to end.
   *
   * An `error` event is not decoration on any of this: it is the only in-band
   * report of a failure the completion signal may not carry, so it is queued
   * in order and raised as a throw when the consumer reaches it.
   *
   * **`requireStreamDelivery` closes the gap a handle's own capability cannot.**
   * `onStream` is advertised whenever the client has an attached server, which
   * on a durable queue is the *possibility* of delivery rather than a
   * guarantee: the job may be claimed by a worker in another process, whose
   * events never reach here. Which process claims a job is not knowable at
   * `send` time, so the only honest advertise-time answer would be to withhold
   * `onStream` from every durable queue — refusing streaming for the ordinary
   * single-process deployment that works today. The discriminator is available
   * here instead, and it is the terminal marker rather than a delta count: a
   * locally-claimed job always emits it (`FetchUrlJob.executeStream` calls
   * `emitStreamEnd` whenever the context carries `emitStreamEvent`, which
   * `JobQueueWorker.executeJob` supplies unconditionally), even for a 304 or a
   * zero-length body, while a remotely-claimed one produces nothing and this
   * loop exits through its settlement fallback with `streamEnded` false.
