 * Runs while reporting to the event channel a parent process installed.

 * This is the one place that decides, which is what makes every command in
 * every CLI built on this package reportable without being rewritten: they all
 * reach their graph through {@link withCli}.
 *
 * A successful graph reports a `result`, NOT a `run_end`. One command commonly
 * runs several graphs in sequence — `sync lists` rebuilds six tables, `sync
 * all` walks every leaf — and each of those reaches here separately. Ending
 * the run on the first one (and closing the channel behind it) is what made
 * `embarc-data sync lists` report two tasks and one table's row count for a
 * command that rebuilt six. The run ends when the PROCESS does, which the
 * parent already observes.
 *
 * A failure is different, and does end the run: it propagates out of the
 * command, so nothing further is coming, and the message is worth more than
 * the exit code the parent would otherwise synthesize.

 * It exists because a run whose length is set by the size of the data can
 * accumulate memory in proportion to how many times it re-renders. Measured on
 * one `sync` sweep, same machine and database: 249 MB -> 1,148 MB across 3,000
 * filings with the UI on, flat at 297 MB with it off, and ~3x faster.
 *
 * The cause is NOT Ink, and this flag is the blunter of the two remedies.
 * React's DEVELOPMENT build instruments commits for the profiler, emitting
 * `performance.measure()` per component per commit; Node's user-timing buffer
 * is unbounded and nothing in a headless process drains it, so every entry is
 * retained for the process lifetime. A progress UI re-rendering continuously
 * for hours is simply the workload that makes an unbounded buffer visible.
 *
 * So prefer `NODE_ENV=production`, which drops the instrumentation entirely
 * and is also markedly faster; measured over 8,000 re-renders the heap stays
 * flat at ~15 MB and yoga node count never moves. Reach for this flag when the
 * production build is not an option, or when the terminal output itself is
 * unwanted — it works by removing the renders, which removes the accumulation
 * as a side effect rather than by fixing it.
